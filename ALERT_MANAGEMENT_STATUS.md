# Alert Management Issue Analysis and Solution

## Issue Summary

The Alert Management functionality in the GTV Motor PHP application is **partially working**. Here's what we found:

### ✅ What's Working
- **Alerts Notifications API** (`/api/alerts/notifications`) - ✅ Working
- **Alert Counts** - ✅ Working (shows 13 total alerts, 10 overdue, 2 due soon, 1 follow-up)
- **Database** - ✅ Working (service_alerts table exists and has data)

### ❌ What's Not Working
- **Dashboard Alerts API** (`/api/dashboard/alerts`) - ❌ Connection failed
- **Main Alerts API** (`/api/alerts`) - ❌ Returns HTML instead of JSON
- **Detailed Alert Data** - ❌ Not accessible due to API issues

## Root Cause

The issue is that the **Dashboard Alerts endpoint** (`/api/dashboard/alerts`) is failing to connect, and the **Main Alerts endpoint** (`/api/alerts`) is returning HTML instead of JSON, suggesting a routing or server configuration issue.

## Current Status

The system shows:
- **Total Alerts**: 13
- **Pending Alerts**: 13
- **Overdue Alerts**: 10
- **Due Today**: 0
- **Due Soon**: 2
- **Service Due**: 10
- **Warranty Alerts**: 2
- **Follow-up Alerts**: 1

## Solution Implemented

I've implemented a **temporary workaround** that:

1. **Uses the working alerts notifications endpoint** instead of the failing dashboard alerts endpoint
2. **Shows summary information** based on alert counts
3. **Displays placeholder alerts** for demonstration purposes
4. **Provides clear status information** to users about the current issue

## Files Modified

### Frontend Changes
- `app/alerts/page.tsx` - Updated to use working API endpoint and show status information

### Backend Changes (Not Deployed Yet)
- `backend/api/alerts/notifications.php` - Enhanced to include detailed alert data

## Next Steps to Fully Fix

### Option 1: Fix Dashboard Alerts Endpoint
1. Check server configuration for `/api/dashboard/alerts` routing
2. Verify the endpoint is properly deployed
3. Check server logs for errors

### Option 2: Deploy Enhanced Notifications Endpoint
1. Deploy the updated `backend/api/alerts/notifications.php` file
2. The enhanced endpoint will include detailed alert data
3. Frontend will automatically use the detailed data

### Option 3: Create New Alerts Endpoint
1. Create a new working alerts endpoint
2. Update frontend to use the new endpoint
3. Ensure proper routing and deployment

## Testing

To test the current solution:

1. **Frontend**: The alerts page now shows summary information and status
2. **API**: Use `https://api.gtvmotor.dev/api/alerts/notifications` to get alert counts
3. **Database**: The service_alerts table contains 13 alerts

## Recommendation

**Immediate**: The current workaround provides a functional alert management interface with summary information.

**Long-term**: Deploy the enhanced notifications endpoint or fix the dashboard alerts endpoint to provide full functionality.

The alert management system is **functional but limited** - users can see alert counts and status, but detailed alert information requires backend fixes.
